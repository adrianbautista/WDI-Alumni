#WDI Alumni Page
Welcome to the open sourced WDI alumni website project. If you're a WDI graduate or current student,
feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request to improve/build upon it.

##Development Tips
Since our styles are written in SASS, we need to compile the styles into CSS.
So in the command line, run the following commands:
* `gem install compass`
* `cd PROJECT_PATH`
  * ex. `cd ~/Documents/Workspace/wdi-alumni`
* `compass watch`
